* **Machine Problem No. 4: Bayesian Network for Healthcare Diagnosis** 

  In this task, you will develop a Bayesian Network model to diagnose a common health condition using Python and the pgmpy library. The goal is to understand how probabilistic reasoning can aid in medical diagnosis by creating a network that models relationships between symptoms, conditions, and diagnostic results.
